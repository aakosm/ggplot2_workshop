# 1. Data visualisation principles

Minimize noise, maximize signal in your graphs (or put it in other ways: maximize the data-ink ratio):

```{r, out.width = "350px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56713bf4dc5cb41142f28d1f/5671e8bf816924fc22651410/5671eae2816924fc2265189a/1450306274301/data-ink.gif?format=original")
```
    
*source: [Darkhorse Analytics](https://www.darkhorseanalytics.com/blog/data-looks-better-naked)*


* avoid chart junk
* Choose the type of plot depending on the type of data
* label chart elements properly and informatively
* ideally both x and y axis starts at 0 (scales can be *really* deceiving otherwise)
* use consistent units! (do not mix yearly and month GDP for example)
* ABSOLUTELY NO 3D PIE CHARTS. (When someone does 3D pie charts God makes a kitten cry.)



Me, seeing 3D charts (I am trigerred equally no matter the sub genre):

# 2. `ggplot2` and its extensions

The name stands for *grammar of graphics* and it enables you to build your plot layer by layer and having the ability to control every detail of the output  (if you so wish). It is used by many in academia, by the Financial Times and FiveThirtyEight writers, among many others. During this workshop we will go through various types of data visualisations and try to apply the above set principles to our output.

You create plots with the below syntax:  

```{r, out.width = "300px", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/ggplot_formula.png")
```


```{r}
# loading and shaping data
library(readr)
library(dplyr)

# data sources
library(gapminder)
library(eurostat)
library(maps)

# general data visualisation
library(ggplot2)
library(ggridges)
library(ggthemes)

# network related packages
library(ggraph)
library(tidygraph)

```


```{r}
# data
iris_df <- iris

tarantino_538 <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/tarantino/tarantino.csv")

gapminder_df <- gapminder

oecd_sum <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aakosm/perg_ggplot2_workshop18/master/data/oecd_sum.csv")

stocks <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aakosm/perg_ggplot2_workshop18/master/data/stock_data.csv")
```

## 2.0 building our first ggplot

Let's create the foundation of our plot by specifying for `ggplot` the data we use and the variable we want to plot.

```{r}
p_hist <- ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
                 mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap))

# what happens if we just use this?
p_hist
```


We need to specify what sort of shape we want our data to be displayed. We can do this by adding the `geom_histogram()` function with a `+`

```{r}
p_hist + 
    geom_histogram()
```

Looks a little bit skewed. Let's log transform our variable with the `scale_x_log10()` function.

```{r, message=TRUE}
p_hist + 
    geom_histogram() +
    scale_x_log10()
```

As the message says, we can mess around with the binwidth argument, so let's do that.

```{r}
p_hist + 
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.05) +
    scale_x_log10()
```

## 2.1 scatter plot (`geom_point()`)

We use scatter plot to illustrate some association between two continuous variable. Usually, the `y` axis is our dependent variable (the variable which is explained) and `x` is the independent variable, which we suspect that drives the association. 

Now, we want to know what is the association between the gdp per capita and life expectancy

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point()
```

Now that we have a basic figure, let's make it better. We transform the x axis values with the `scale_x_log10()` and add text to our plot with the `labs()` function. Within `geom_point()` we can also specify geom specific options, such as the alpha level (transparency).

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + # inside the geom_ we can modify its attributes. Here we set the transparency levels of the points
    scale_x_log10() + # rescale our x axis
    labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
         y = "Life expectancy",
         title = "Connection between GDP and Life expectancy",
         subtitle = "Points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder")
```



To add some analytical power to our plot we can use `geom_smooth()` and choose a `method` for it's smoothing function. It can be `lm`, `glm`, `gam`, `loess`, and `rlm`. We will use the linear model ("lm"). *Note: this is purely for illustrative purposes, as our data points are country-years, so "lm" is not a proper way to fit a regression line to this data.*


```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
    scale_x_log10() +
    geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "orange") + # adding the regressiom line
    labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
         y = "Life expectancy",
         title = "Connection between GDP and Life expectancy",
         subtitle = "Points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder")


```

what if we want to see how each continent fares in this relationship? We need to include a new argument in the mapping function: `color = `. Now it is clear that European countries (country-years) are clustered in the high-GDP/high life longevity upper right corner.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) + # color by category
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() + # rescale our x axis
    labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
         y = "Life expectancy",
         title = "Connection between GDP and Life expectancy",
         subtitle = "Points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder")
    
```



We add horizontal line or vertical line to our plot, if we have a particular cutoff that we want to show. We can add these with the `geom_hline()` and `geom_vline()` functions.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) + # color by category
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() +
    geom_vline(xintercept = 3500) + # adding vertical line 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 70, linetype = "dashed", color = "black", size = 1) + # adding horizontal line
    
    labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
         y = "Life expectancy",
         title = "Connection between GDP and Life expectancy",
         subtitle = "Points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder")

```



## 2.2 histogram

Using histograms to check the distribution of your data as we have seen in the intro.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_df,
       mapping = aes(x = lifeExp)) +
    geom_histogram() 
```

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder_df,
       mapping = aes(x = lifeExp)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black", fill = "orange") # we can set the colors and border of the bars and set the binwidth or bins 
```


We can overlay more than one histogram on each other. See how different iris species have different sepal length distribution.
```{r}
ggplot(data = iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     fill = Species)) +
    geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, position = "identity", alpha = 0.65) # using the position option so we can see all three variables
           
```

## 2.3 density plots

A variation on histograms is called density plots that uses Kernel smoothing (fancy! but in reality is a smoothing function which uses the weighted averages of neighboring data points.)

```{r}
ggplot(iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
    geom_density()
```

Add some fill
```{r}
ggplot(iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
    geom_density(fill = "orange", alpha = 0.3)
```

Your intutition is correct, we can overlap this with our histogram

```{r}
ggplot(iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length)) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..),
                   binwidth = 0.1,
                   fill = "white",
                   color = "black") +# we add this so the y axis is density instead of count.
    geom_density(alpha = 0.25, fill = "orange")

```

And similarly to the historgram, we can overlay two or more density plot as well.

```{r}
ggplot(iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     fill = Species)) +
    geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```


## 2.3.1 ridgeline/joyplot

This one is quite spectacular looking *and* informative. It has a similar function as the overlayed histograms but presents a much clearer data. For this, we need the `ggridges` package which is a `ggplot2` extension.

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Sepal.Length,
                     y = Species,
                     fill = Species)) +
    geom_density_ridges(scale = 0.8, alpha = 0.5)
```


## 2.4 bar charts

We can use the bar charts to visualise categorical data. Let's prep some data.

```{r}
tarantino_rip <- tarantino_538 %>% 
    filter(type == "death")

ggplot(data = tarantino_rip,
       aes(x = movie)) +
    geom_bar()

```

We can use the `fill` option to map another variable onto our plot. Let's see how these categories are further divided by the type of event in the movies (profanity or death). By default we get a stacked bar chart.

```{r}
ggplot(tarantino_538, aes(movie, fill = type)) +
    geom_bar()

```

we can use the `position` function in the `geom_bar` to change this. Another neat trick to make our graph more readable is `coord_flip`.
```{r}
ggplot(tarantino_538, aes(movie, fill = type)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
    coord_flip()
```

Let's make sure that the bars are proportional. For this we can use the `y = ..prop..` and `group = 1` arguments, so the y axis will be calculated as proportions. The `..prop..` is a temporary variable that has the `..` surrounding it so there is no collision with a variable named prop.

```{r}
ggplot(tarantino_538, aes(movie, fill = type)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge",
             aes(y = ..prop.., group = type)) +
    coord_flip()

```

Maybe it is best to facet by type.

```{r}
ggplot(tarantino_538, aes(movie, fill = type)) +
    geom_bar(position = "dodge",
             aes(y = ..prop.., group = type)) +
    coord_flip() +
    facet_wrap(~type, ncol = 2)
```


### 2.4.1 Lollipop charts

The lollipop chart is a better barchart in a sense that it conveys the same information with better data/ink ratio. It also looks better. (note: some still consider it a gimmick)

For this we will modify a chart from the [Data Visualisation textbook](http://socviz.co/groupfacettx.html#avoid-transformations-when-necessary)



```{r}
# for the data see the github repository of the workshop

p <- ggplot(data = oecd_sum,
       mapping = aes(x = year, y = diff, color = hi_lo)) 


p + geom_segment(aes(y = 0, x = year, yend = diff, xend = year)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme(legend.position="none") +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Difference in Years",
       title = "The US Life Expectancy Gap",
       subtitle = "Difference between US and OECD
                   average life expectancies, 1960-2015",
       caption = "Adapted from Kieran Healy: Data Visualisation, fig.4.21 ")

```


## 2.5 box plot

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Species,
                     y = Sepal.Length)) +
    geom_boxplot()

```


We add color coding to our boxplots as well.

```{r}

ggplot(data = iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Species,
                     y = Sepal.Length,
                     fill = Species)) +
    geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.5)
```



## 2.6 violin chart

```{r}
ggplot(data = iris_df,
       mapping = aes(x = Species,
                     y = Sepal.Length)) +
    geom_violin()
```


## 2.7 line chart


For this we use data on stock closing prices. As we are now familiar with the ggplot2 syntax, I do not write out all the `data = ` and `mapping = `.

```{r}
ggplot(stocks, aes(date, stock_closing, color = company)) +
    geom_line()
```

Add some refinements.

```{r}
ggplot(stocks, aes(date, stock_closing, color = company)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(x = "", y = "Prices (USD)",
         title = "Closing daily prices for selected tech stocks",
         subtitle = "Data from 2016-01-10 to 2018-01-10",
         caption = "source: Yahoo Finance")
```


faceting helps.

```{r}
ggplot(stocks, aes(date, stock_closing, color = company)) +
    geom_line(size = 1) +
    labs(x = "", y = "Prices (USD)",
         title = "Closing daily prices for selected tech stocks",
         subtitle = "Data from 2016-01-10 to 2018-01-10",
         caption = "source: Yahoo Finance") +
    facet_wrap(~company, nrow = 4)
```


# 3. Themes and plot elements

## 3.1 Themes
In this section we will go over some of the elements that you can modify in order to get an informative and nice looking figure. `ggplot2` comes with a number of themes. You can play around the themes that come with `ggplot2` and you can also take a look at the `ggthemes` package, where I included the economist theme. Another notable theme is the `hrbthemes` package.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
diamonds_df <- dplyr::sample_n(diamonds, 250)

p1 <- ggplot(data = diamonds_df,
             mapping = aes(x = carat,
                           y = price)) +
    labs(title = "ggplot default") +
    geom_point()

p2 <- ggplot(data = diamonds_df,
             mapping = aes(x = carat,
                           y = price)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "theme_bw") +
    theme_bw()

p3 <- ggplot(data = diamonds_df,
             mapping = aes(x = carat,
                           y = price)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "theme_minimal") +
    theme_minimal()

p4 <- ggplot(data = diamonds_df,
             mapping = aes(x = carat,
                           y = price)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(title = "theme_economist") +
    theme_economist()

gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2, ncol = 2)
```

Try out a couple to see what they differ in! The `ggthemes` package has a nice collection of themes to use. The theme presets can be used with the `theme_*()` function.
```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.25) + 
    scale_x_log10() + 
    theme_minimal() # adding our chosen theme
```


## 3.2 Plot elements

Of course we can set all elements to suit our need, without using someone else's theme.

The key plot elements that we will look at are:  

* labels
* gridlines
* fonts
* colors
* legend
* axis breaks

Adding labels, title, as we did before.
```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() + 
    labs(x = "GDP per capita", 
         y = "Life expectancy",
         title = "Connection between GDP and Life expectancy",
         subtitle = "Points are country-years",
         caption = "Source: Gapminder",
         color = "Continent") # changing the legend title

```

Let's use a different color scale! We can use a color brewer scale (widely used for data visualization).

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() + 
    scale_color_brewer(name = "Continent", palette = "Set1") # adding the color brewer color scale

```

Or we can define our own colors:

```{r}

ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() + 
    scale_color_manual(values=c("red", "blue", "orange", "black", "green")) # adding our manual color scale
```


To clean up clutter, we will remove the background, and only leave some of the grid behind. We can hide the tickmarks with modifying the `theme()` function, and setting the `axis.ticks` to `element_blank()`. Hiding gridlines also requires some digging in the `theme()` function with the `panel.grid.minor` or .major functions. If you want to remove a gridline on a certain axis, you can specify `panel.grid.major.x`. We can also set the background to nothing. Furthermore, we can define the text attributes as well in our labels.

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() + 
    theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), # removing axis ticks
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), 
          panel.background = element_blank()) # removing the background
```



Finally, let's move the legend around. Or just remove it with `theme(legend.position="none")`. We also do not need the background of the legend, so remove it with `legend.key`, and play around with the text elements of the plot with `text`.

```{r}

ggplot(data = gapminder_df,
             mapping = aes(x = gdpPercap,
                           y = lifeExp,
                           color = continent)) +
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5) + 
    scale_x_log10() + 
    theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(), # removing axis ticks
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(), # removing the gridline
          panel.background = element_blank(), # removing the background
          legend.title = element_text(size = 12), # setting the legends text size
          text = element_text(face = "plain", family = "sans"), # setting global text options for our plot
          legend.key=element_blank(),
          legend.position = "bottom")# removing the background
```


While we are at it, we want to have labels for our data. For this, we'll create a plot which can exploit this.

What we use is the `geom_text` to have out labels in the chart.

```{r}
gapminder <- gapminder %>% 
    filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")


ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, gdpPercap, label = country)) + # we add the labels!
    geom_point() +
    geom_text() # and use the geom text

```

notice the different outcome of `geom_label` instead of `geom_text`.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, gdpPercap, label = country)) + # we add the labels!
    geom_point() +
    geom_label() # and use the geom label
```

If we want to label a specific set of countries we can do it from inside ggplot, without needing to touch our data.

```{r}
ggplot(gapminder, aes(lifeExp, gdpPercap, label = country)) + # we add the labels!
    geom_point() +
    geom_text(aes(label = if_else(lifeExp > 80, country, NULL)), nudge_x = 0.5) # we add a conditional within the geom. Note the nudge_x!
```


# 4. Special cases

## 4.1 Network visualization
Let's load our data from an edgelist. We are using the `tidygraph` `ggraph` packages, but both are heavily dependent on the `igraph` package which is one of the most powerful one for network analysis in R.

```{r}
# data
edges_got <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/melaniewalsh/sample-social-network-datasets/master/sample-datasets/game-of-thrones/got-edges.csv")
```


let's create the network object and add some network statistics to our small social network
```{r}
soc_nw <- as_tbl_graph(edges_got, directed = FALSE) %>% 
  activate(nodes) %>% 
  mutate(centrality = centrality_eigen(), community = as.factor(group_infomap()))
```


We plot the network with the `ggraph()` function, that is a network oriented extension of `ggplot2`. The nodes and links are plotted separately with the `geom_edge_*` and `geom_node_*`. In this case `link` and `point`.
```{r}
ggraph(soc_nw, layout = "kk") +
  geom_edge_link(alpha = 0.35) +
  geom_node_point()
```

alternative with modifications to link and node attributes. Note the `theme_graph()` at the end.
```{r}
ggraph(soc_nw, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Weight), alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.5,2)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality), alpha = 0.8) +
  theme_graph()
```

final touch, let's add the communities in the network and labels for our nodes.

```{r}
ggraph(soc_nw, layout = "fr") +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = Weight), alpha = 0.2) +
  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.5,1.5)) +
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality, color = community), alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size = 3, repel = TRUE) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  labs(title = "Social network of the Song of Ice and Fire books",
       caption = "Data: <github.com/melaniewalsh/sample-social-network-datasets>") +
  theme_graph()

```


## 4.2 Maps
Two essential parts of creating a map with `ggplot2`:
- shapefile which draws the map
- some data that we want to plot over the map

Getting the map data from the `maps` package
```{r}
world <- map_data("world")
```


We can plot the empty map 
```{r}
ggplot(data = world,
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") +
  coord_cartesian()
```


We can also subset the map data, just as we can with any other R object
```{r}
# subsetting the world data
world_subset <- world[world$region == "France",]

ggplot(data = world_subset,
       mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +
  geom_polygon(fill = "white", color = "black") +
  coord_cartesian()
```




adding data to our map. If you are not familiar with the `dplyr` package, it is one of the better data wrangling solutions out there. We subset our gapminder data for the year 1977. Then add a new row that matches the region variable in the map data so we can merge the two dataset. (we also get rid of Antarctica, because of aesthetics)

```{r}
year_2000 <- gapminder_df %>% 
  filter(year == 1977) %>% 
  mutate(country = as.character(country))

# adding key variable for merge
year_2000$region <- year_2000$country

# merging the data and the map and getting rid of antarctica
world_data <- left_join(world, year_2000, by = "region") %>% 
  filter(region != "Antarctica")
```

And now we can plot the map and data with the `geom_polygon()` and `coord_quickmap()`. I also made some modifications to the theme, so it looks better.
```{r}
ggplot(world_data, aes(long, lat, group = group, fill = lifeExp)) +
  geom_polygon(color = "gray90", size = 0.05 ) +
  coord_quickmap() +
  labs(fill = "Life expectancy",
       title = "Life expectancy around the world",
       subtitle = "1977",
       caption = "Data: Gapminder") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(na.value = "white", direction = -1) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.line=element_blank(),
        axis.text=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks=element_blank(),
        axis.title=element_blank(),
        panel.background=element_blank(),
        panel.border=element_blank(),
        panel.grid=element_blank(),
        panel.spacing=unit(0, "lines"),
        plot.background=element_blank(),
        legend.justification = c(0,0),
        legend.position = c(0,0)
  )

```





### 4.2.1 example from the Eurostat package

The [vignette](https://ropengov.github.io/eurostat/articles/eurostat_tutorial.html#maps) contains the full tutorial on how to use the eurostat package to get data through the eurostat API. If you are interested check it out later.

We get the data, which is disposable household income data for NUTS2 regions. We merge it with the shapefile, that we have in the `geodata` object.
```{r}
dat <- get_eurostat("tgs00026", time_format = "raw", stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>% 
  # subsetting to year 2014 and NUTS-2 level
  dplyr::filter(time == 2014, nchar(geo) == 4) %>% 
  # classifying the values the variable
  dplyr::mutate(cat = cut_to_classes(values))


# Download geospatial data from GISCO
geodata <- get_eurostat_geospatial(resolution = "60", nuts_level = "2")

# merge with attribute data with geodat
map_data <- inner_join(geodata, dat)

```

plotting with the `coord_sf`
```{r}
ggplot(data=map_data) + 
  geom_sf(aes(fill=cat),color="dim grey", size=.1) + 
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Oranges") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse=T, title = "euro")) +
  labs(title="Disposable household income in 2014",
       caption="(C) EuroGeographics for the administrative boundaries 
       Map produced in R with a help from Eurostat-package <github.com/ropengov/eurostat/>") +
  theme_light() + 
  theme(legend.position=c(.8,.8)) +
  coord_sf(xlim=c(-12,44), ylim=c(35,70))

```

If we want to add arbitrary points to the map, we can do that by specifying the longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates.

```{r}
long <- c(10)
lat <- c(50)
my_city <- as.data.frame(cbind(long,lat))
```


Then just plot over our map with the `geom_point()`

```{r}
ggplot(data=map_data) + 
  geom_sf(fill= "white", color="dim grey", size=.1) + 
  geom_point(data = my_city, aes(x = long, y = lat), color = "orange", size = 5, alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_light() +
  coord_sf(xlim=c(-12,44), ylim=c(35,70))
```
